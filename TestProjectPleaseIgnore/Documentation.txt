SUMMARY OF PROGRAM STATE PRIOR TO EDITING

	The program was recieved in a semi-workig condition. 80% of the program's features were working but the source code was un organized and convoluted.
	Listed below is an outline of the two classes used to create the program and their associated memebers. 

LIST OF CLASSES

1. Journal.cs
2. Topics.cs

JOURNAL CLASS MEMEBERS

Global Variables:

	activeID
	totalRows
